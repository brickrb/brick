# Why GemTime?

RubyGems and Bundler have long served the Ruby community well. In fact, RubyGems just recently passed the twelve year anniversary of its initial commit. However, Ruby is starting to lag behind as compared to other languages. Security vulnerabilities and other issues had been an issue a few years ago with RubyGems.org and Bundler. As well, it is better for the Ruby community to have one place to look to, not have a separate system for installing manifested dependencies (Bundler) as compared to have just one system for everyone to use.

Ruby has also fallen a bit behind in terms of contributions. New and emerging communities such as CocoaPods and npm have had larger community involvement. I believe it is time for the Ruby community to become involved again. This can stem from just having small events such as Bug Bashes, and other community-oriented events. This types of events are vital to keeping a community alive, and iterating.

Improving the infrastructure and implementation of gem hosting is also important. Allowing mirrors to be created in an easy and efficient way is crucial for the global Ruby community. Those who are geographically far away from Amazon's US East data center should not experience enormous load times. As well, it should be easy for someone to spin up their own private gem hosting service. These are problems other dependency managers have solved, and I think it is time for the Ruby community to solve these problems.

## With the above stated, I am proposing that RubyGems, Bundler, and RubyGems.org be rethought and rewritten.

This is the ultimate purpose of GemTime - to be the one-stop shop for Ruby dependencies, similar to how other programming languages have one steadfast brand, CocoaPods for Cocoa, and npm for Node.js.
